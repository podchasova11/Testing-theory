--1. Show all workers names and their salary 
-- 'INNER JOIN' is equal to 'JOIN'
--[Inner] JOIN (default) - A join that displays only the rows that have a match in both joined tables :
SELECT employee_name AS workers, monthly_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN employee_salary es
ON e.id = es.employee_id
JOIN salary s
ON s.id = es.salary_id;

--or with clause 'WHERE':

SELECT employee_name AS workers, monthly_salary
FROM employees e, salary s, employee_salary es

WHERE e.id = es.employee_id
AND s.id = es.salary_id

--OUTER JOIN - A join that includes rows even if they do not have related rows in the joined table. There are 3 types of outer (unmatched rows to be included) joins:
--– LEFT [OUTER] JOIN  show all matched rows of left and right tables (as in inner join) and leftovers of left table (where there is no value would be null).
--– RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN show all matched rows of left and right tables (as in inner join) and leftovers of right table (where there is no value would be null)
--– FULL [OUTER] JOIN show all rows of right and left tables (as in inner join) and leftovers of both tables (where there is no value would be null)

--CROSS JOIN - A join whose result set includes one row for each possible pairing of rows from the two tables.
